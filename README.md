## *Design and Analysis Algorithms (DAA) Course Project*

### Hello, we are Team-6 of E-division
#### 🤝 Team members
- Drishti Nagshetty 👋
- Aditi Choudhary 👋
- Sanika Madihal 👋
- Nandita Gaitonde 👋

We are a group with diverse skills but passionate towards same goals which we achieve through skills and hardwork. Here's a glimpse of our work:

## 📚 *Course*
- DAA course is real time applications of the algorithms and improving the workflow in various fields of technologies.
- We study the history and how each algorithm was developed,the inspirations behind each and how, new algorithm is the improved version of the previous one. 

## 📝 *Topics studied* 
- Stack,Queue,Linked List
- Trees, Graphs,Trie, Skip list, Heap
- Bubble, Quick, Selection, Insertion sort
- Djikstra, Kruscal etc

## 🚀 *Skills*
- C,C++, Python,SQL
- Data Structures and Algorithms

## 🛠️ *Project* 
- This portfolio is to depict our smart city design that we worked upon.
- Individual team-mates will be identifying business case studies and working further by incorporating appropriate algorithm in solving and developing the city design.

## 📋 *Problem definition*
Surrounded by human habitat, there is an area of 1500 square kilometres that government of India wants to convert into a smart city. Government is also cautious from the failed cities like Lavasa, Masdar etc. Prepare a city plan proposal for the government.
