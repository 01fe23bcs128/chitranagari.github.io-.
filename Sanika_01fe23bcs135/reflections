1. There are several kind of phenomena we see in the nature which describes or can be solved using the daa techniques like iteration, recursion and backtracking. For instance when it comes to iteration the rise and fall of the tidal waves is one of the best example to explain the iteration process where there is repeated pattern or regularity between each tide.Recursion is best described by the pattern of the cauliflower which shows the recursive pattern of the flower from stem to the tips.Whereas, backtracking is widely applicable in navigating the maze. We can use these natural problem solving techniques in daa to solve similar kind of problems in algorithmic world
